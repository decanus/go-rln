# go-rln

Wrappers for [kilic/rln](https://github.com/kilic/rln) along with an implementation for rate-limiting using RLN inspired
by the [Waku v2 RLN Relay](https://rfc.vac.dev/spec/17/) built by [Status](https://status.im).

Further research can be found here:

 - https://github.com/vacp2p/research/tree/master/rln-research

The goal of this is to create a block submission rate-limiter for [Celestia](https://celestia.org/)
